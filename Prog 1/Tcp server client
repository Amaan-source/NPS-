Topic  :   TCP Server-Client implementation in C
The entire process can be broken down into following steps:

TCP Server –

Step 1: using create(), Create TCP socket.
Step 2: using bind(), Bind the socket to server address.
Step 3: using listen(), put the server socket in a passive mode, where it waits for the client to approach the server to make a connection
Step 4: using accept(), At this point, connection is established between client and server, and they are ready to transfer data.
Go back to Step 3.


TCP Client –

Step 1: Create TCP socket.
Step 2: connect newly created client socket to server.
